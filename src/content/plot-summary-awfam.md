<p><span>The play opens onboard a sailing ship in a violent storm. The Master, Boatswain, and sailors argue with Albert, Aminta, and their French companions over how best to weather the storm.

We learn that Albert has abducted Aminta from her family but still hopes to make things right with an honest marriage. Clear tensions are drawn between the sexes and between the pious and the practical. The crew eventually spots an island in the distance and steers the ship towards the shore. </span><br/></p>

We learn of the young Clarinda (who has never seen a man before), her mother Rosella (who rules this commonwealth of women), and Crocale, Hippolita, and Juletta (who relish their freedom and pine for sexual contact with men). Crocale relates a dream about a young man coming to her bed. When Albert washes up on shore, he mistakes the women for goddesses and begs for their help before fainting. Clarinda examines Albert's unconscious body and, after puzzling over him, realizes that he is a man. She is attracted to him and begins to feel jealous when she sees another woman's hair bandaging his wounds. Rosella discovers Albert among the women and upbraids them for entertaining him. She reminds them that part of their mutual agreement in forming a commonwealth was the abjure the company of men. She also notes that they learned to live as Amazons from a group of indigenous women who once inhabited the island. However, after listening to the women's demands, she consents to a sexual exchange of one month with the men on the other island. Anxious about Clarinda's interest in him, Albert lies and says that the stranded Aminta is his sister, begging for a quick return to her. </span><br/></p>

The Amazons offer their help and sexual services on two conditions: (1) that the men ask nothing of their pasts; and (2) that the men surrender their weapons. Tibalt then assesses each man’s humor to match him with the most compatible woman. The men decide to use the treasure they received from Sebastian and Nicusa to woo the Amazons. The sight of the treasure triggers a violent outburst when the women realize that it is their own lost treasure. Rosella assumes that the men killed Sebastian (her husband) and stole the treasure from him.
